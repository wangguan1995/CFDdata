# Experiment Location and Facility:
1. Conducted in the low-speed wind tunnel at the Key Laboratory of Power Machinery and Engineering, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
2. Wind tunnel dimensions: 2m (length) × 0.3m (width) × 0.3m (height).
3. 800 mm long outlet section installed downstream of the test section to mitigate wind tunnel exit reflection influence.
# Wind Tunnel Specifications:
1. Experimental centrifugal fan driven by a 1.5 kW variable frequency motor.
2. Wind speed control through a digital frequency converter, ranging from 2 to 30 m/s.
3. Uniformity of the average velocity in the core region: < 0.7%.
4. Background turbulence intensity in the free-stream core region: < 0.6%.
# Research Object and Measurement Techniques:
1. Research object: NACA0012 airfoil, a typical low Reynolds number airfoil.
2. Synchronized measurements using:
a. TR-PIV (Time-Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry).
b. Dynamic pressure sensor linear array system.
3. Measurements coordinated and controlled by a LabVIEW program.
# Experimental Setup:
1. Chord length of the airfoil: 150 mm.
2. Experimental conditions detailed in Table 1.
3. PIV velocity distributions under various experimental conditions presented in Fig. 4.
